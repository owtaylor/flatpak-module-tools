{#
The mock configuration defined by this template is shared between building RPMs
to use with a runtime, and building Flatpak containers for that runtime. The main
reason for doing this is that we can share the DNF cache, which is hardcoded to live
within /var/cache/{{ root }}/dnf_cache. To avoid problems from the fact that
chroot_setup_cmd is different, we disable the root cache for the container builds,
where it is not very useful because there are few packages.

arch: str - as understood by RPM
includepkgs: List[str] - global list of includepkgs, used only for container builds against modules
releasever: str - operating system version without prefix
repos: List[str] - DNF repository definitions
root_cache_enable: [False|True]
runtimever: str - runtime branch, typically operating system version with prefix
